sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
If fallocate is not available, you can use dd:

bash
Copy code
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096
Set the Correct Permissions: Change the permissions of the swap file so that only the root user can read and write to it:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
Mark the File as Swap Space: Set up a Linux swap area on the file:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkswap /swapfile
Enable the Swap File: Turn on the swap file so that the system starts using it:

bash
Copy code
sudo swapon /swapfile
Make the Swap File Permanent: To ensure the swap file is used at every boot, add it to the /etc/fstab file. Open the file in a text editor with root privileges:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line to the end of the file:

bash
Copy code
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
Verify the Swap Space: Check that the system is using the new swap file:

bash
Copy code
sudo swapon --show
free -h
